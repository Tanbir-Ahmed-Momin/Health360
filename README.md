# Health360
This project Created an IoT system using C/C++, Flutter, and ESP32, enabling real-time tracking of body temperature, heart rate, and ECG. Implemented a user-friendly mobile app for instant data visualization, showcasing my expertise in end-to-end project execution.


The project provides the opportunity for the doctors to monitor the health of the patients even outside the hospital or apart from the duty hours using IoT the health of the patients is monitored remotely. This project is cost effective and provides timely response to improve the patientsâ€Ÿ health it avoids the patients to have long stays in hospital it helps them to move freely and walk
happily with the help of wireless sensors. This are the measurable benefits which avoids the patients from daily regular visits to hospitals which is extremely painful for chronically ill, elderly and bedridden patients in home. Hence in total by using the project we can solve many of the healthcare problems which the society is facing and improve the quality of better human life.
